Define overrides for the Network-layer DDoS Attack Protection managed rulesity level of the detection mechanism. You can [define overrides-rulesets/network/configure-dashboard/) or [define overrides via Rulesets API](/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/network/configure-api/).

The available parameters are the following:

- Action

The action performed for packets that match specific rules of Cloudflare's DDoS mitigation services. The available actions are:

- **Log**
  - API value: `"log"`.

- **Bloce rule expression given the sensitivity levels.

- **DDoS Dynamic**
  - API value: _N/A_ (internal rule action that you cannot use in overrides).
